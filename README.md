_I have a long background (over ten years) of using advanced fluorescence imaging approaches to uncover some of the many mysteries in cell biology. Over time I have become a hybrid software engineer / biologist, where I use my background in the wet lab and behind the microscope to inform appropriate processing and analytical decisions. I completed my Ph.D. in Bill Bement's lab at UW-Madison where I optimized high-speed imaging approaches to study a fascinating dance between the Rho GTPases and their effectors. I also established simple and extremely effective computational approaches to quantify otherwise overwhelmingly complex time-lapse datasets. I currently work at Elephas Biosciences where my team and I are developing advanced 3D imaging and analysis approaches for live human tumor fragments._

## Technical Skills

### Biomedical Imaging
- 10 years of hands-on experience using advanced fluorescence imaging modalities with cells and tissues. Approaches include light-sheet, traditional widefield/confocal, two-photon/TCSPC, STED, SIM, and iSIM.
- Deep understanding of image formation, resolving power, and limitations of different imaging modalities.

### Computational
- Strong programming skills using Python to process and analyze biomedical images. Extensive experience using distributed computing to process out-of-memory datasets and GPUs to accelerate bottleneck processing steps. 
- Practical experience training and deploying machine learning and deep learning models for image restoration, object detection, classification, and 2/3D cell and tissue segmentation using PyTorch and Tensorflow.
- Extensive experience with team software development, including fluency with version control (git), environment control (conda, venv), testing (pytest), and a commitment to writing clean and well-documented code.
- Some experience developing image processing applications using C# and the .NET framework.

### Cell and Molecular Biology
- Extensive experience using insect and mammalian cell culture for knockdown screens, transformations, and protein expression. 
- Broad background background of using CRISPR, reverse genetics, and RNAi in Drosophila. 
- Experienced microinjecting DNA, RNA and protein into _Drosophila_, _Xenopus_, and _Danio_ embryos.

### Management and teamwork
- I currently manage a team of scientists at Elephas Biosciences focused on developing advanced imaging and analysis approaches for two-photon/TCSPC images of human tumor fragments.
- Co-managed a shared imaging facility (1 Bruker swept field confocal, 1 Prairie point scanning confocal, 1 Olympus FV1000 confocal, 1 Flamingo light sheet system) to maximize system use, minimize the impact of routine maintenance, and enhance system features. Educated new users on system features, analysis techniques, and best practices. 
- Mentored 4 undergraduates over the course of 4 years to learn modern molecular biology and imaging approaches as well as scientific reading and writing proficiency.

## Research experience
**Elephas Biosciences | Image Data Scientist, Team Leader | 2022 - Current**
- I work collaboratively with wet-lab researchers, commercial operations, and other software developers to develop and deliver image processing and analysis software to meet commercial and R&D needs.
- Developing infrastructure (tested and versioned Python libraries) for centralized processing of multi-photon FLIM images including phasor-based probe un-mixing, metabolic measurements, and cell/tissue segmentation.
- Established a centralized database and pipeline for human-annotated images to allow continuous fine tuning of deep learning models for label-free segmentation and classification images of human tissue.
- Constructed and deployed a fully automated pipeline to stitch out-of-memory montages and derivative datasets, decreasing processing time by over 15x and increasing quality compared to the previous state of the art.
- Used GPU-acceleration to decrease the time required for tissue segmentation in OCT image volumes by 30X.
