## About Me

_I have an extensive background using advanced fluorescence imaging approaches to uncover some of the many mysteries in cell biology. Over time I have transitioned to becoming primarily a software developer, where I use my background in the wet lab and behind the microscope to inform appropriate processing and analytical decisions. I completed my Ph.D. in Bill Bement's lab at UW-Madison where I optimized high-speed imaging approaches to study a fascinating dance between the Rho GTPases and their effectors. I also established simple and extremely effective computational approaches to quantify otherwise overwhelmingly complex time-lapse datasets. I currently work at Elephas Biosciences where my team and I are developing advanced 3D imaging and analysis approaches for live human tumor fragments._

## Education and Technical Training
2022 | Ph.D. | [University of Wisconsin, Madison](https://cmb.wisc.edu/)  
2016 | [Analytical and Quantitative Light Microscopy](https://www.mbl.edu/education/advanced-research-training-courses/course-offerings/analytical-and-quantitative-light-microscopy)  
2015 | B.S. | [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://mcd.ucsc.edu/)  

## Technical Skills

### Biomedical Imaging
- 10 years of hands-on experience using advanced fluorescence imaging modalities with cells and tissues. Approaches include light-sheet, traditional widefield/confocal, two-photon/TCSPC, STED, SIM, and iSIM.
- An equivalent amount of experience optimizing sample prep for advanced imaging applications. Examples include engineering fluorescent protein conjugates (FPCs) to reduce toxicity, optimizing dosage and expression profiles for FPCs and/or exogenous dyes, and optimizing fixation, staining, and clearing conditions for immunofluorescence.
- Deep understanding of image formation, resolving power, and limitations of different imaging modalities. For those that know, I am always dancing around the pyramid of frustration. 

### Computational
- Strong programming skills using Python to process and analyze biomedical images. Extensive experience using distributed computing to process out-of-memory datasets and GPUs to accelerate bottleneck processing steps. 
- Practical experience training and deploying machine learning and deep learning models for image restoration, object detection, classification, and 2/3D cell and tissue segmentation using PyTorch and Tensorflow.
- Extensive experience with team software development, including fluency with version control (git), environment control (conda, venv), testing (pytest), and a commitment to writing clean and well-documented code.
- Some experience developing image processing applications using C# and the .NET framework.

### Management and teamwork
- I currently manage a team of scientists at Elephas Biosciences focused on developing advanced imaging and analysis approaches for two-photon/TCSPC images of human tumor fragments.
- Co-managed a shared imaging facility at UW-Madison (consisting of a Bruker swept field confocal, a Prairie point scanning confocal, an Olympus FV1000 confocal, and a Flamingo light sheet system) to maximize system use, minimize the impact of routine maintenance, and enhance system features. Educated new users on system features, analysis techniques, and best practices. 
- Mentored 4 undergraduates over the course of 4 years to learn modern molecular biology and imaging approaches as well as scientific reading and writing proficiency.

### Cell and Molecular Biology
- All of the basic molecular biology stuff: DNA/protein preps, DNA/protein gels, traditional/reverse/quantitative PCR, ELISA, Western blots, bacterial cloning, various different flavors of DNA recombination (Gibson, In-fusion cloning, traditional, etc). You get the idea.
- More experience than I'd like using small glass needles to perform micro-surgeries on or to microinject compounds (RNA, proteins, drugs) into various difference types of embryos.
- Extensive practical experience using insect and mammalian cell culture for knockdown screens, transformations, and protein expression. 
- Four years of experience with genetic engineering in _Drosophila_ (forward/reverse genetics, CRISPR knockout/in, RNAi).

## Research experience
**Elephas Biosciences | Image Data Scientist, Team Leader | 2022 - Current**
- I work collaboratively with wet-lab researchers, commercial operations, and other software developers to develop and deliver image processing and analysis software to meet commercial and R&D needs.
- Developing infrastructure (tested and versioned Python libraries) for centralized processing of multi-photon FLIM images including phasor-based probe un-mixing, metabolic measurements, and cell/tissue segmentation.
- Established a centralized database and pipeline for human-annotated images to allow continuous fine tuning of deep learning models for label-free segmentation and classification of human tissue.
- Constructed and deployed a fully automated pipeline to stitch out-of-memory montages and derivative datasets, decreasing processing time by over 15x and increasing quality compared to the previous state of the art.
